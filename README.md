Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
- I thought this assignment was a little more challenging than the others so far! ArrayDeques are great in their functionality but it gave me a little bit more to keep traack of in that I couldn't just use the push() or pop() method -- I had to think about whether I was using it as a queue or a stack, which led to more error. The other big challenge was keeping track of type -- there were lots of instances in which a Character was passed as char accidentally which made the code incompatible. They were all really fun to figure out!

This assignment does lend itself to more visual prototyping, so please feel free to go this route. Are you including slides, pseudocode, comments, or something else?
- I am including 2 images of flowcharts for both the Infix and Postfix class!
